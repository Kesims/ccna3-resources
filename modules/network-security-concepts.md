# Network security concepts

### Common security terms
| Name          | Description                                                                                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Asset         | Anything that has value to an organization (people, equipment, data, etc.).                                           |
| Vulnerability | Weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat.                                                               |
| Threat        | Any potential danger to an asset. (Threat actor = entity seeking to exploit a vulnerability).                         |
| Exploit       | A technique/mechanism used to compromise a system.                                                                    |
| Mitigation    | Counter-action taken to reduce the risk of a threat. Network security usually includes multiple layers of mitigation. |
| Risk          | The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.                                                                |


An attack to a network can be either **external** (from outside the network) or **internal** (from within the network). Internal
attack is usually considered more dangerous.


### Vectors of data loss
- **Email/Social networking** - Intercepted email messages can contain confidential information.
- **Unencrypted devices** - Data stored or transmitted in unencrypted form can be easily intercepted.
- **Cloud services** - Data can be lost if cloud is compromised.
- **Removable media** - Employees can perform unauthorized data transfer, or lose a media device with sensitive data.
- **Hard copy** - Printed documents can be lost, stolen, or seen by unauthorized personnel.
- **Improper access control** - For example easy passwords that can be compromised can allow easy access to corporate data.


### Threat actors
- **Black hat hackers** - Individuals who exploit systems for personal gain.
- **Grey hat hackers** - Individuals who exploit systems without malicious intent. They may disclose vulnerabilities to the owner after having compromised their network.
- **White hat hackers** - Individuals who exploit systems to find vulnerabilities and report them to the owner and are often hired for that purpose.

We can also divide actors as:
- **Script kiddies** - Individuals who use pre-made scripts to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Hacktivists** - Individuals who exploit systems for political or social reasons.
- **Vulnerability brokers** - Individuals who find vulnerabilities and sell them to the highest bidder.
- **Cyber criminals** - Self-employed individuals who exploit systems for their financial gain.
- **State-sponsored actors** - Individuals who exploit systems on behalf of a government.
